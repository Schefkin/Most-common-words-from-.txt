# Most common words from .txt

1) Code selects the most common words from a .txt file
2) Creates another .txt file where it writes out the most common words(except the words that should be ignored)

In this context the tool is used to find the most common vocabulary from a german book and print it to a seperate .txt file.
Basically it's a tool for finding most common vocab from a book, so the person could learn the words before reading.
